Debugging Session Plan: Explaining Segfault, Conditional Jump, and Double Free in C

1. Introduction
- Brief overview: Why debugging is important.
- Explain that these are common runtime errors students will encounter.
- Mention tools they can use (e.g., gdb, valgrind, printf debugging).

2. Segmentation Fault (Segfault)

What to explain:
- Definition: A segmentation fault occurs when a program tries to access memory that it shouldn’t (invalid memory access).
- Causes: Dereferencing NULL pointers, accessing memory beyond allocated arrays, writing to read-only memory, etc.
- Symptoms: Program crashes abruptly.
- Example scenarios where segfault might happen.

How to explain:
- Use a simple analogy: “Imagine your program is trying to open a door that doesn’t belong to it—it’s not allowed, so the system stops it immediately.”
- Show a small code snippet that causes a segfault (e.g., dereferencing NULL).
- Demonstrate how to reproduce the segfault.
- Introduce gdb commands to find the line causing the segfault (run, bt).
- Show how to check pointers before using them.

3. Conditional Jump or Move Depends on Uninitialized Value

What to explain:
- Definition: This warning/error happens when the program makes a decision based on a variable that has not been initialized.
- Why it’s problematic: Using uninitialized variables leads to undefined behavior — the program may behave unpredictably.
- Common cause: Using local variables without setting a value.

How to explain:
- Use analogy: “It’s like trying to choose a path without knowing where the signs point—you don’t have valid information, so your decision could be wrong.”
- Show a code example where a variable is declared but not initialized, then used in a conditional statement.
- Explain how tools like Valgrind detect this problem.
- Teach best practices: Always initialize variables before use.
- Demonstrate fixing the code by initializing variables.

4. Double Free

What to explain:
- Definition: Double free occurs when a program calls free() more than once on the same memory pointer.
- Why it’s a problem: Can corrupt the memory allocator’s data structures, cause crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
- Symptoms: Crashes or undefined behavior when freeing memory.

How to explain:
- Use analogy: “It’s like throwing away your garbage twice; the second time you throw away something that’s already gone, causing confusion.”
- Show a code snippet that calls free() twice on the same pointer.
- Explain how to track memory allocation and freeing.
- Introduce good memory management habits: set pointers to NULL after freeing.
- Demonstrate debugging tools like Valgrind to detect double frees.
