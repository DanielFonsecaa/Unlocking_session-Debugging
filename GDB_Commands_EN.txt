üêû GDB ‚Äî Basic Usage (Commands)

‚öôÔ∏è Compilation
Compile your program with debug symbols:
gcc -g3 program.c -o program

üöÄ Initialization
gdb ./program                     # open program in GDB
gdb ./program core                # open with a core dump file
gdb --args ./program arg1 arg2    # pass arguments to the program

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution
run (or r)                        # start the program inside GDB
run arg1 arg2                     # run with arguments
start                             # run until first instruction of main()
continue (or c)                   # continue after a breakpoint
kill                              # terminate program execution
quit (or q)                       # exit GDB

üéØ Breakpoints
break main                        # set breakpoint at start of main
break 25                          # set breakpoint at line 25 of current file
break file.c:40                   # set breakpoint at line 40 of file.c
break function                    # set breakpoint at beginning of a function
info breakpoints                  # list all breakpoints
delete                            # remove all breakpoints
delete N                          # remove breakpoint N
disable/enable N                  # disable/enable breakpoint N

üß≠ Navigation
next (or n)                       # execute next line (don‚Äôt step into functions)
step (or s)                       # execute next line (step into functions)
finish                            # execute until current function returns
until 30                          # run until line 30

üîç Inspection
print var                         # print variable value
print *ptr                        # print value pointed to by pointer
display var                       # show variable value at each step
undisplay                         # remove active displays
info locals                       # show local variables of current function
info args                         # show arguments of current function
backtrace (or bt)                 # show stack trace (call stack)
frame N                           # switch to frame N (in call stack)
info registers                    # show CPU registers
x/10x addr                        # examine memory (10 hex values from addr)

üß© Useful Control Commands
list (or l)                       # show source code
list 20,40                        # show lines 20 to 40
info functions                    # list known functions
info variables                    # list global variables
